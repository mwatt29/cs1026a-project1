# What This Project Does
The fund.py project implements an Investment Fund Analysis Tool. It calculates and analyzes key financial metrics for a hypothetical investment fund to evaluate its performance over a period. It likely includes functionalities for:

Portfolio value calculation.
Returns analysis.
Risk assessment.
Features of the Project
Fund Metrics Calculation:

Calculates financial indicators such as returns, growth, or net asset value (NAV).
Performs time-based analysis of fund performance.
Data Input/Output:

Allows importing data from predefined sources or files.
Outputs results in a user-friendly format for decision-making.
Customizable Settings:

Flexible parameters for analysis (e.g., time periods, fund components).
Modular Design:

The tool likely has reusable methods for calculating metrics, enabling scalability for additional features.

he guess.py project implements a Number Guessing Game, where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number within a specific range. It provides feedback and tracks attempts, aiming to make the game engaging and interactive.

Features of the Project
Random Number Generation:

Generates a random target number using Python's random module.
Interactive Gameplay:

Prompts the user to guess a number.
Provides feedback (e.g., "Too high!" or "Too low!") to guide the player.
Win Condition:

Tracks the number of attempts.
Announces the winner when the correct guess is made.
Customizable Range:

Likely allows specifying the range of numbers for gameplay.


Both projects showcase:

Investment Fund Analysis Tool: Financial and analytical skills, Python programming, and modular design.
Guessing Game Script: Interactive programming, randomization, and user experience design.
